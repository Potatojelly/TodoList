### Context for the Project

I wanted to better understand the principles of React and state management and build a tool to manage daily tasks effectively. 

### Objective

The focus was on getting a deeper understanding of how React components work, how state is managed in React using Hooks, and how user interactions can be effectively handled.

### Challenges and Learning Experiences

Identifying the logic to toggle Dark and Light Mode without adding complicated codes was the primary challenge. 

This project helped to deepen my basic knowledge and skills in Reacts
